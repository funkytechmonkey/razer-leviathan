# Razer Leviathan auto off firmware fix

The Razer Leviathan sound bar has an annoying auto off "feature" where it turns off after several minutes of silence.

[Razer Support have provided a firmware update](https://insider.razerzone.com/index.php?threads/razer-leviathan-auto-power-off-firmware-fix.21208) with auto off disabled, which you can install from here. [Previous "solutions"](https://insider.razerzone.com/index.php?threads/razer-leviathan-auto-power-off-fix.5128) involved playing sound on a timer.

## How to update the firmware

1. Format a USB drive to FAT32. This is the only format tested.
2. Put the `beethoven11_v1.0.0.0.mdu` file on the USB drive.
3. Disconnect all cables from the back of the sound bar.
4. Pull the sticker cap labeled `Service Port` off the back of the sound bar.
5. Plug the USB drive into the service port.
6. Plug only the power cable into the sound bar.
7. While the firmware is updating the Source lights (left of the power button) will cycle.
8. When the firmware update is complete all of the Equalizer lights (right of the power button) will be lit.
9. Remove the power cable from the sound bar.
10. Remove the USB drive.
11. Plug all the cables back into the sound bar and use as normal.
